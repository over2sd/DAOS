I built DAOS because I found it frustrating to try to pick background colors
for my Web sites using only the analysis tools available online at the time.
I felt that this method (picking a color and checking it against an
analyzer) wasted a lot of my time. What I needed was a tool that would take
what I'd already chosen and tell me which background colors would match it
well.
So, I built DAOS. The first two versions were written in c++ and relied on
third-party code I couldn't distribute freely.
This third version is entirely unencumbered code, so I'm able to release it
in its entirety to the Public Domain.
Enjoy it.
